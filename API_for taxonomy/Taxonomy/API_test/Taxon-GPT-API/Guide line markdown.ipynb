    "## Introduction\n",
    "Taxonomy, as a branch of systematics, holds critical importance across various biological disciplines. Accurate taxonomic information is essential for taxonomists to analyze evolutionary relationships between species, assess morphological characteristics, and name new species. However, this process heavily relies on natural language and involves extensive manual work to handle taxonomic data, consuming significant time and human resources. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent performance in Natural Language Processing (NLP). In this manuscript, we demonstrated the GPT-4o model, a efficient LLM, can effectively handling natural language in taxonomic research, using relevant data to generate taxonomically meaningful results. We developed the **Taxon-GPT-API** function, which utilizes the GPT-4o model to process Nexus matrix data, converting it into taxonomic keys and taxonomic descriptions, providing an innovative automated approach to taxonomic data processing."

    "## Obtain the OpenAI API key and configure it as an environment variable:\n",
    "To integrate the TaxonGPT function, the OpenAI API (Application Programming Interface) must be utilized. Connecting to the OpenAI API can invoking relevant models provided by OpenAI. Since the API key is a sensitive and confidential code, it is crucial to prevent exposing the key or submitting it through a browser.To ensure the API key is securely imported and avoid any potential risk, it is mandatory to set the API key as a system environment variable before using the TaxonGPT function.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the API key is correctly set, the TaxonGPT function will proceed with the subsequent operations. However, if the API key is not properly loaded into the environment, the TaxonGPT function will return an appropriate prompt, providing instructions to help check and resolve the issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Correctly Obtain and Use OpenAI's API Key:**\n",
    "1. Locate the \"API\" section at the bottom of the OpenAI interface.\n",
    "2. Log in to your user account through the API login portal and navigate to the API interface.\n",
    "3. Click on the \"Dashboard\" located at the top right corner.\n",
    "4. Access the \"API keys\" interface to manage your API keys.\n",
    "5. Click on \"Create new secret key\" at the top right corner.\n",
    "6. Create the API key and ensure to save and record this key properly for future use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid uploading this API key to public spaces or sharing it with others. Additionally, ensure it is not visible in any client scripts or network environments. This precaution helps prevent data leaks and mitigates the risks of violating usage terms."

    "Based on the results of the initial classification, we developed a secondary classification API to process the species within each cluster separately for further classification. In this secondary classification API, each call uses only the morphological matrix information of all species within the respective cluster, thereby reducing the computational processing complexity of the model and contributing to higher quality and more accurate results. After completing the secondary classification API, we additionally established a JSON API to standardize the output format for each cluster. Including format standardization directly within the secondary classification API would affect the quality of the results, and the standardized output format {type: JSON} proposed by OpenAI is also unsuitable. Therefore, an additional JSON API was implemented to standardize the output results, facilitating further subsequent operations."
