TaxonGPT: A program for taxonomic classification using generative AI natural language capabilities
====

## Introduction
Taxonomy, as a branch of systematics, holds critical importance across various biological disciplines. Accurate taxonomic information is essential for taxonomists to analyze evolutionary relationships between species, assess morphological characteristics, and name new species. However, this process heavily relies on natural language and involves extensive manual work to handle taxonomic data, consuming significant time and human resources. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent performance in Natural Language Processing (NLP). In this manuscript, we demonstrated the ChatGPT-4o model, a efficient LLM, can effectively handling natural language in taxonomic research, using relevant data to generate taxonomically meaningful results. We developed the <strong>TaxonGPT (API)</strong> function, which utilizes the ChatGPT-4o model to process Nexus matrix data, converting it into taxonomic keys and taxonomic descriptions, providing an innovative automated approach to taxonomic data processing.

## Installation
To use the TaxonGPT function, you can download the TaxonGPT.py file located in the main directory. Then, run it in your local Python environment.

TaxonGPT can be installed by following this instruction on Github.\
TaxonGPT depends on the Python package openai, please make sure it is installed as well.

https://github.com/hhua361/Taxon-GPT-API.git/Taxonomy/TaxonGPT.py
 ### Steps:
1. To use the TaxonGPT function, you can download the TaxonGPT.py file located in the main directory. Then, run it in your local Python environment.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Run the following command in your terminal to execute the file:

```
python path/to/TaxonGPT.py
```
## Obtain the OpenAI API key and configure it as an environment variable
To integrate the TaxonGPT function, the OpenAI API (Application Programming Interface) must be utilized. Connecting to the OpenAI API can invoking relevant models provided by OpenAI. Since the API key is a sensitive and confidential code, it is crucial to prevent exposing the key or submitting it through a browser.To ensure the API key is securely imported and avoid any potential risk, it is mandatory to set the API key as a system environment variable before using the TaxonGPT function.

If the API key is correctly set, the TaxonGPT function will proceed with the subsequent operations. However, if the API key is not properly loaded into the environment, the TaxonGPT function will return an appropriate prompt, providing instructions to help check and resolve the issues.

### How to Correctly Obtain and Use OpenAI's API Key:
1. Locate the "API" section at the bottom of the OpenAI interface.
2. Log in to your user account through the API login portal and navigate to the API interface.
3. Click on the "Dashboard" located at the top right corner.
4. Access the "API keys" interface to manage your API keys.
5. Create the API key and ensure to save and record this key properly for future use.

*** Once you have obtained the API code from OpenAI, the first step is to configure the API within the environment variables. This can be done by executing the appropriate configuration commands in PowerShell. After successfully configuring the API in the environment, it is essential to restart the terminal window to ensure that the changes take effect, and then use the relevant commands to verify the environment variables.
```
# For configuring environment variables (API) in PowerShell. (For Windows)
setx OPENAI_API_KEY “YOUR_API_KEY”
# Verifying whether the environment variables (API) were successfully imported in the new PowerShell session. (For Windows)
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY

# For configuring environment variables (API) in PowerShell. (For Linux/macOS)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-api-key"
# Verifying whether the environment variables (API) were successfully imported in the new PowerShell session. (For Linux/macOS)
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
```
#### ⚠️Caution: Refrain from disclosing your API key to unauthorized individuals or posting it in publicly accessible locations.
## Overview

> ### Usage
>To utilize the TaxonGPT.py file effectively, a configuration file is required. This configuration file should include the necessary input file paths and the output file path. The essential information within the config file includes:
>* **API Key**: Your OpenAI API key.
>* **Paths**: A dictionary containing the paths to the input and output files.
#### You need to put the config file and TaxonGPT.py in the same directory, TaxonGPT.py will automatically recognize the config file
```
This is just an example of the config file format that will be shown.

To generate taxonomic results efficiently, ensure the configuration file contains the correct file paths. Based on the specific requirements for generating classification results, different branch functions can be used.
```
# Through TaxonGPT() to generate the related result
TaxonGPT = TaxonGPT(config_file_path)

# Generate the Taxonomic Key
TaxonGPT.process_key()

# Generate the Taxonomic Description
TaxonGPT.process_description()

The main stems of the assimilating shoots are both erect and decumbent (4), and they are bright green in color (5). These stems are slightly rough (6) and bear whorls of slender branches at the nodes (7). The main stems die down in autumn (8). The longitudinal internodal grooves in the main stem internodes of the assimilating shoots are deep, with prominent ridges between (10). The main stem internodes have a central hollow (11), which is much less than half the diameter of the internode and about half the diameter of the internode (12). The endodermis in the main stem internodes of the assimilating shoots comprises a single layer outside the ring of vascular bundles (13). The main stem sheaths of the assimilating shoots are about as broad as long (14). The teeth of the main stem sheaths of the assimilating shoots are ribbed (16). The primary branching is symmetrical (18), and the primary branches are numerous (19). These branches are both spreading and drooping (20). The primary branches of the assimilating shoots are simple (21), and the first primary branch internodes are at least as long as the subtending sheaths, at least on the upper parts of the stem (22). The primary branch internodes are solid (23). The stomata of the assimilating shoots are not sunken relative to the adjacent epidermal cells (24). The cones are blunt (25). The spores are fertile (26) and are released in April (27). This species belongs to the subgenus Equisetum (28) and the section Vernalia (29).
