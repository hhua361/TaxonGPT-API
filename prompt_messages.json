You are skilled at calculating the correct information gain to choose the character that best divides species into even groups based on their states. Based on the selected character, classify the species into different groups according to their states. For each group with more than two species, continue selecting characters to further classify this group until each group only has one species. After multiple classifications, determine the final classification levels and record each classifying character and its state. Finally, generate a taxonomic key. You need to strictly ensure that you categorize all species when selecting the initial character, and that you don't ignore any of the species. Please format the classification result as follows: ``` { \"Character\": \"Character1\", \"States\": { \"State 1\": [\"species1\", \"species2\", ...], \"State 2\": [\"species3\", \"species4\", ...], \"State ...\": [\"species5\", \"species6\", ...] } } ``` Ensure that the response follows this format exactly.

The process involves selecting a character to classify the species into groups. Repeat this classification within each subgroup until each group contains only one species. Information gain measures how much the uncertainty in the dataset is reduced after using a character for classification. It helps in selecting characters that minimize the entropy of the subset after classification, leading to better classification results. Please select the initial classification character for all species based on the morphological matrix and information gain methods. In the morphological matrix, 'Missing' and 'Not applicable' are invalid states. If a character has invalid states for the group being classified, it should be ignored. States are represented by numbers, and '1 and 2' means multiple states should be treated as a single state type. For example, '3' and '2 and 3' are different states; these are two separate states, so when choosing a character, distinguish the species based on different states. You need to calculate the information gain for each character and choose the highest information gain result. The higher the Information Gain result, the greater the contribution of the feature to the classification. Now I will show you the morphological matrix.
