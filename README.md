TaxonGPT: Efficient Taxonomic Data Conversion and Key Generation with GPT-4o model
====

## Introduction
Taxonomy, as a branch of systematics, holds critical importance across various biological disciplines. Accurate taxonomic information is essential for taxonomists to analyze evolutionary relationships between species, assess morphological characteristics, and name new species. However, this process heavily relies on natural language and involves extensive manual work to handle taxonomic data, consuming significant time and human resources. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent performance in Natural Language Processing (NLP). In this manuscript, we demonstrated the GPT-4o model, a efficient LLM, can effectively handling natural language in taxonomic research, using relevant data to generate taxonomically meaningful results. We developed the <strong>TaxonGPT (API)</strong> function, which utilizes the GPT-4o model to process Nexus matrix data, converting it into taxonomic keys and taxonomic descriptions, providing an innovative automated approach to taxonomic data processing.
